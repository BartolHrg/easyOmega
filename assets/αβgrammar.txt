to make group use <> braces
immediatelly after opening < write group name
groups can be nested
<group
    content
>

whitespace at the beggining of the line is ignored

comments have to have double backslash \\ at the beggining (with optional indentation)
    \\ my comment

mapping is done like this
first specify name than colon : than single space and than value to be mapped to and end with newline
name can be of any printable characters (ascii 33 - 126)
Sigma: Î£
to include newline in value, escape it with backslash \. 
Also note that indentation on the first line is subtracted from following lines 
    2lines: first\
      2nd
example above maps to "first\n  second"
